# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
In order to help Bobby’s manager to prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age, you will perform the following tasks:
1. determine the number of retiring employees per title
2. identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program
3. write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami”

## Results:
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


## Summary:
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
